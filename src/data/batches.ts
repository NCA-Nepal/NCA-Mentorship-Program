One day, while scrolling through Facebook, I saw a post about free classes by NCA@Nepal. I filled out the form and joined the Discord server. After joining NCA@Nepal, I developed my skills and used my time in the best possible way. The friendly behavior of the mentors and the vision of NCA@Nepal inspired me to contribute to the cybersecurity community. The mentors are highly skilled and experienced, teaching in a way that feels like you're learning from friends. Since joining NCA@Nepal, I've been able to avoid distractions and procrastination, maintain consistency in learning new things every day, and strive to be a better version of myself than yesterday. I was impressed with the mentors' friendly behavior and their teaching techniques, which focus on real-life examples and practical learning rather than just theory. They also guide you in playing CTFs if you're interested. I can confidently say that the syllabus is far better than the programs offered by institutions that charge over 25k for just a two-month course. The only things you need to join NCA@Nepal mentorship program are passion, enthusiasm to learn, and your valuable time.",

As a Minecraft nerd, I was hooked. Back then, I thought CTFs were just ‚Äúexploiting systems that are already broken? Why bother?‚Äù But the team showed me the magic: CTFs aren‚Äôt about ‚Äúwinning‚Äù fake hacks‚Äîthey‚Äôre blueprints for spotting real-world flaws.They gave me a roadmap, explained categories like rev/pwn (my favorite‚ÄîI love breaking systems!), and introduced me to mentors who answered my endless ‚ÄúWait, how?!‚Äù questions.

Additionally, I discuss various topics with my NCA team and learn from them. It has been 5 months since I joined this server, and I am still regularly active. The reason for my regular activity is that this server and its members have taught me many things. Even though I am just a BA student, I am grateful for the opportunity to be a member of the NCA server and to be included as a member of a CTF team. Before joining this server, I didn‚Äôt even know how to install Kali Linux. However, I can now play CTF games on Kali Linux and have learned the basics of penetration testing. I didn‚Äôt know much about Docker before, but I have now learned how to run Docker and use it effectively. One thing I‚Äôve realized after joining the NCA team server is that working as a team provides many opportunities to learn and grow together. Thank you.",
